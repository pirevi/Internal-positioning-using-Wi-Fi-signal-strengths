# Internal positioning using Wi-Fi signal strengths
We have a data set containing signal strengths of seven different WiFi routers located in four rooms. The number of observations are 2000. Based upon the signal strength of all the seven WiFi signals recorded in the device at a particular moment we aim to determine the location of the device using various classification methods.

## We have tried:
- Knock of data from dataset
- Various imputation techniques to fill missing data
- One hot encoding
- ROC and AUC for multiclass classification
- Compare various classification model
